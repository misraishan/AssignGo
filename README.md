# AssignGo
An easy way to track your assignments, quickly and efficently.

## Reasoning
I created this app because, at the time, there were no ad-free options WITH a clean and intuitive design (plus dark mode). It was my first real coding project, however I am working on re-doing parts of the code base to keep it relavent for myself. 

## Features
- Dark mode (by default)
- Local notifications
- Color-coded assignments/subjects
- Default notification times
    - 1 day before
    - 12 hours before
    - 2 days before (if the assignment is "prioritized")

## Installation
Make sure you have flutter installed on your machine. If not, you can install it from [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Usage    
To run the app, use the following command:
```dart
flutter run
```
